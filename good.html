                        <h2>Matt Bishop</h2>
                        <p>A senior dance major at Colorado State University and President of the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/hiphopdanceclubcsu/">CSU Hip-Hop Dance Club</a>, Matt has choreographed multiple times for CSU and has extensive dance training in hip-hop, tap, jazz, ballet, and modern. With experience as a lighting designer for CSU's summer dance program <a href="https://dance.colostate.edu/dance-lab/">DanceLab</a>, two years in a row, Matt has a developed skillset in lighting design and understands not just dance, but how production elements can be incorporated to support and make a dance piece better.</p>

                        <h2>Phantalsm</h2>
                        <p>A polywag that won't give me his bio and a CS major that's too smart for his own good, Phantalsm produces quality music that has the "REWIND" ability and can blow up on YouTube multiple times. Producing songs in numerous capacities, Phantalsm is his own beat producer, songwriter, singer, and audio engineer. A full jack-of-all-trades that can effectively address all elements of producing a song, Phantalsm desires to leave a legacy through what he creates. As he says, "Let time to witness my actions, It's never necessary to know my identity. Only what I bring into the world."</p>
